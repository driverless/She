"She" Lyrics
# Verse
wake up in the morning
the sun beat down on me
but it can't stop me thinking
everything has changed

I looked up at the azure
I wish it was a dream
but now I know it's for real
she already left

# Bridge
I think about
what made mistakes
I running around 
where have you gone
I walked across 
the place we've been to
in the end I see her tonight

# Chorus
then she say
we can't back
to the past 
she turned and left me
just let me stay here now

then I stay
I can't change
her mind
she last words to me
it in my deep memory

# Bridge
I still stay
I still stay 
I still stay
I still stay
