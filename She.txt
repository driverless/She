"She" Lyrics
# Verse
wake up in the morning
the sun beat down on me
but it can't stop me thinking
everything has changed

# Verse
wake up in the morning
I wish it was a dream
but now I know it's for real
I don't want you to leave  
  
# Bridge
then I running around 
where have you gone
then I think about
what made mistakes

# Bridge
then I walked across 
the place we've been to
in the end I see her tonight

# Chorus
then she say
I can't change
her mind
she still care about me
but it's just not enough now

# Chorus
then she say
we can't back
to the past 
she turned and left me
just let me stay here now

# Bridge
I stay
I stay
I stay
I stay
